## What is Git 🙃?

Git is a version control system developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds/#:~:text=Linus%20Torvalds%2C%20the%20creator%20of,of%20social%20coding%20among%20programmers.). It's an opensource program which helps coders
- To commit/save the changes in their code.
- Navigate back in time to see how their code looked at a specific point of time.
- Create branches to add/test new features non-destructively.

## Why do we need to learn Git 🤔?
Being a developer/programmer isn't an easy job and the changes in projects are inevitable. 
<br>Before git what we use to do was
- Create multiple copies of code naming them Project, Project11, ProjectFinal, ProjectToDeploy etc.🥲 
- If not like above then we need to re-code the features which we removed last sprint thinking it's not needed.

Therefor git is an essential tool which each and every developer should know. It simplifies the process by keeping track of the changes we did to our code over a period of time.

## Is git and github same 🧐?
Nope I would rephrase it as "Github is a cloud version of git" i.e. github in addition of basic git feature also provides facilities like
- Code sharing
- Team
- Deployment
- CI/CD 

## Demystifying Jargons 🪄
| S. No  | Jargon                   | Desctiption |
| ------ | ---------                | ------------- |
| 1      | clone                    | Download the code |
| 2      | commit                   | To save the changes such that we could revisit that state of code in future |
| 2      | Repository               | Folder in which our code is saved |
| 2      | fork                     | To create copy of someone's code from their github repo to our github repo  |
| 2      | pull request             | After fork if you make any impprovements in code and want the original creator to merge the changes in original repo you create pull request. Kind of invitation. |
| 2      | branch                   | To create a copy of current repo and experiment on it. In future it could be merged with main code or deleted |
| 2      | merge                    | To add the new feature created on branch A to main/master branch |

## What are some basic git commands that everyone should know 😏?
| S. No  | Command                  | Desctiption |
| ------ | ---------                | ------------- |
| 1      | git init                 | To initioalize git |
| 2      | git clone                | To clone a repository in local system |
| 2      | git status               | To check what files have been changed from last commit |
| 2      | git add .                | To add all the changes to staged changes list |
| 2      | git commit -m "message"  | To commit the staged changes with a comment describing change |
| 2      | git push                 | To push the commited code to repository |
| 2      | git log                  | To check past commits |
